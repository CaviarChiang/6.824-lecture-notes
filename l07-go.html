<h1>Russ Cox's lecture on Go</h1>

<h2>Why Go?</h2>

<ul>
<li>an answer to the problems of scalability at Google
<ul>
<li><code>10^6+</code> machines design point</li>
<li>it's routine to be running on 1000 machines</li>
<li>constantly writing programs that coordinate with each other
<ul>
<li>sometimes MapReduce works, other times it doesn't</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Who uses Go at Google</h2>

<ul>
<li>SPDY proxy for Chrome on mobile devices uses a Go-written <em>Data Compression Proxy</em></li>
<li>dl.google.com</li>
<li>YouTube MySQL balancer</li>
<li>the target is network servers, but it's a great gen. purp. language</li>
<li>Bitbucket, bitly, GitHub, Dropbox, MongoDB, Mozilla services, NY Times, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concurrency</h2>

<ul>
<li>"Communicating Sequential Processes", by Hoare, 1978
<ul>
<li>strongly encouraged to read</li>
<li>in some sense, a generalization of UNIX pipelines</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bell Labs had some languages developed for concurrency in 80's, 90's:
<ul>
<li>Pan, Promela, Newsqueak, Alef, Limbo, Libthread, Concurrent ML</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Google developed Go in the 2000s</li>
</ul>

<h3>There's no goroutine IDs</h3>

<ul>
<li>"There's no goroutine IDs, so I can't kill my threads"
<ul>
<li>This is what channels are for: just tell your thread via a channel to shut itself off</li>
<li>Also, it's kind of "antisocial" to kill them.
<ul>
<li>What we mean is that your program is prolly not gonna work very well if you keep killing your threads like that</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Channels vs. Mutexes</h3>

<ul>
<li>if you need a mutex, use a mutex</li>
<li>if you need condition variable, think about using a channel instead</li>
<li>don't communicate by sharing memory, you share memory by communicating</li>
</ul>

<h3>Network channels</h3>

<ul>
<li>it'd be great to have the equivalent for a network channel</li>
<li>if you take local abstractions (like channels) and use them in a new
context like a network, ignoring failure modes (etc), then you're gonna
run into trouble</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scale of engineering efforts</h2>

<p>In 2011, Google had:</p>

<ul>
<li>5000+ developers </li>
<li>20+ changes per minute</li>
<li>50% code base changes every month (files? not lines probably)</li>
<li>50 million test cases executed per day</li>
<li>single code tree projects</li>
</ul>

<p>A new language was needed to fix the problems that other languages had with software engineering at this scale</p>

<p>The scale of compilation matters. 
 - When you compile a package A that depends on B, most (all?) languages need to compile B first
 - Go doesn't.
 - Dependencies like these at the scale of Google projects slow down compilation if you use a traditional language
   + gets worse with "deeper" dependencies <code>A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;...</code>
 - <em>Example:</em> at some point they found a postscript interpreter compiled in a server binary for no reason due to weird deps</p>

<h3>Interfaces vs. inheritance</h3>

<ul>
<li>inhertance hierarchies are hard to get right and if you don't they are hard to change later</li>
<li>interfaces are much more informal and clearer about who owns and supplies what parts of the program</li>
</ul>

<h3>Readability and simplicity</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dick Gabriel quote: 
<blockquote>
  <p>"I'm always delighted by the light touch and stillness of early programming languages. Not much text; a lot gets done. Old programs read like quiet conversations between a well-spoken research worker and a well-studied mechanical colleague, not as a debate with a compiler. Who'd have guessed sophistication bought such noise?"</li>
<li>Simplify syntax</li>
<li>Avoid cleverness: ternary operators, macros</li>
<li>Don't let code writing be like "arguing with your compiler"</li>
<li>Don't want to puzzle through code 6 months later</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Design criteria</h2>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>started by Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer and Ken Thompson in late 2007</li>
<li>Russ Cox, Ian Lance Taylor joined in mid-2008</li>
<li>design by consensus (everyone could veto a feature, if they didn't want it)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Generics</h3>

<ul>
<li>Russ: "Don't use <code>*list.List</code>, you almost never need them. Use slices."
<ul>
<li>Generics are not bad, just hard to do right.
<ul>
<li>Early designers for Java generics also agreed and warned Go designers to be careful</li>
<li>Seems like they regretted getting into that business</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Enginering tools</h3>

<ul>
<li>when you have millions of lines of code, you need mechanical help
<ul>
<li>like changing an API</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go designed to be easy to parse (not like C++)</li>
<li>standard formatter</li>
<li>Means you can't tell a mechanical change from a manual change
<ul>
<li>enables automated rewrites of code</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>More automation</h3>

<ul>
<li>fix code for API updates
<ul>
<li>early Go versions API changed a lot</li>
<li>Google had a rewriter that would fix your code which used the changed APIs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>renaming struct fields, variables w/ conflict resolution</li>
<li>moving packages</li>
<li>splitting of packages</li>
<li>code cleanup</li>
<li>change C code to Go</li>
<li>global analysis that figure out what are all the implementors of an interface for instance</li>
</ul>

<h2>State of Go</h2>

<ul>
<li>Go 1.4 released in Decembeer 2014</li>
<li>Go 1.5 has toolchain implemented in Go, not in C
<ul>
<li>concurrent GC</li>
<li>Go for mobile devices</li>
<li>Go on PowerPC, ARM64</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lots of people use it</li>
<li>Go conferences outside of Google/Go</li>
</ul>

<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

<ul>
<li>Go vs C/C++
<ul>
<li>Go is garbage collected, biggest difference, so slower</li>
<li>Go can be faster than Java sometimes</li>
<li>once you're aware of that, you can write code that
runs faster than C/C++ code</li>
<li>no reason that code that doesn't allocate memory
shouldn't run as fast as C/C++</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Goal to use Go outside Google?
<ul>
<li>Yes! Otherwise the language would die?</li>
<li>You get a breadth of experts that give you advice and write tools, etc.
<ul>
<li>C++ memory model guy gave feedback on Go memory model</li>
<li>Very usefl</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not trying to replace anything like language X
<ul>
<li>but they were using C/C++ and didn't want to anymore</li>
<li>however Python and Ruby users are switching to Go more</li>
<li>Go feels just as light but statically type checked</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Studies about benefits of Go?
<ul>
<li>not a lot of data collected</li>
</ul></li>
