<h1>6.824 2015 Lecture 12: Eventual Consistency</h1>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These lecture notes were slightly modified from the ones posted on the
6.824 <a href="http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2015/schedule.html">course website</a> from 
Spring 2015.</p>

<h2>Exam</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bring papers and lecture notes for exam</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bayou: Eventual consistency</h2>

<ul>
<li>a set of copies of the data, where applications can use any copy of the data</li>
<li>local read/write</li>
<li>even if the network breaks, I can still use the local copy
<ul>
<li><em>disconnected operation</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>ad-hoc synchronization
<ul>
<li>laptop, phone, tablet can synchronize amongst each other instead 
of relying on Internet connection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>can work with database servers that have different data and synchronize
with each other</li>
<li>similar to Ficus, but Bayou has more sophisticated conflict resolution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conflicts</h3>

<ul>
<li>what to do about the inevitable conflicts that happen when you allow people
to write to their local copies and synchronize them later</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meeting room scheduler</h3>

<p>Traditional approach (central server):</p>

<pre><code>    PDA
|-----------------
|9am    824 staff     |----------------|
|--                   |  Server        |
|10am        -------------&gt; | DB   |   |
|--                         | 9am  |   |
|11am                       | 10am |   |
|--                                    |
|12pm                                  |
|--
</code></pre>

<p>Not a good approach because it requires everyone to have connectivity to
the server.</p>

<p>Would be nice if you have PDA send appointment to laptop, whoc can then send it
to the server.</p>

<pre><code>    PDA
|-----------------
|9am    824 staff     |----------------|
|--                   |  Server        |
|10am                       | DB   |   |
|--                         | 9am  |   | &lt;-----\
|11am                       | 10am |   |        \
|--                                    |         |
|12pm                                  |      laptop
|--      \                                      /
          \-----------------------------------&gt;/
</code></pre>

<h3>Update functions</h3>

<p><strong>Main idea:</strong> Update functions. Instead of the application saying "write this DB
record", the application hands a function that behaves differently based on
what's in the DB.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>if free at 10am
    reserve @10am</li>
<li>else if free at 9am
    reserve @9am</li>
<li>else
    reserve</li>
</ul>

<p>Bayou takes this function from the PDA and gives it to the laptop.</p>

<p>Suppose A and B want the same times:</p>

<ul>
<li>A wants: either staff meeting at 10  or 11</li>
<li>B wants: hiring meeting at 10 or 11</li>
</ul>

<p>If you simply apply these functions to node A's and B's databases, that's not
enough:</p>

<ul>
<li>X syncs with A
10am staff meeting</li>
<li><p>X syncs with B
11am hiring meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Y syncs with B
10am hiring meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Y syncs with A
11am staff meeting</p></li>
<li><p>now X and Y have differing views</p></li>
</ul>

<p><code>=&gt;</code> have to execute <code>A</code>'s and <code>B</code>'s update functions in the same order</p>

<h3>Numbering updates</h3>

<p><strong>Next idea:</strong> number update functions, so that you can view them as being a log</p>

<ul>
<li>Classic way to order things is to stamp them with numbers and sorting</li>
<li>initially let the Bayou update ID be <code>&lt;time T, nodeId&gt;</code>
<ul>
<li>possible for time <code>T</code> to be the same for two update IDs, but then
the node IDs will differ (presumably)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ordering rules:
<ul>
<li><code>a &lt; b</code> if <code>a.T &lt; b.T</code> or <code>a.T == b.T and a.ID &lt; b.ID</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If we take the previous example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;T=10, nodeId=A&gt;, A wants: either staff meeting at 10  or 11
&lt;T=20, nodeId=B&gt;, B wants: hiring meeting at 10 or 11
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>When Y syncs with B and then with A, it'll see A's update occurred earlier</li>
<li>so it undoes B's update, applies A's and then B's again</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to be able to roll back and re-execute the log.</p>

<p>Are the updates consistent with causality?</p>

<ul>
<li>PDA A adds a meeting</li>
<li>A synchronizes with B</li>
<li>B deletes A's meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>If some 3rd node sees these updates, it would be necessary to have the meeting 
creation timestamp be smaller than the deletion timestamp.</p>

<h3>Lamport logical clock</h3>

<p>Each node maintains <code>T_max</code>, the highest timestamp this node has ever seen
from itself or from another node.</p>

<p>When a node creates an event and adds it to the log, it picks timestamp <code>T =
max (T_max + 1, wall clock time)</code></p>

<ul>
<li>new timestamps are always higher than timestamps the node has ever seen</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tentative entries, commit scheme</h3>

<p>It's annoying that entries in the calendar are always displayed as tentative
because another (earlier) update could come in and replace it.</p>

<ul>
<li>maybe because the new update sender was disconnected for a long time</li>
</ul>

<p>We're looking for a way to all agree that anything above a certain point in the
log will never change (it's frozen, no one can modify stuff there)</p>

<p><strong>Bad idea:</strong> One possibility is to have all the replicas exchange summary w/
each other about what they've seen:</p>

<ul>
<li>X has seen all A's updates through 20, B's through 17, and C's through 72
<ul>
<li>these are timestamps (logical clocks)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we know that X will never create a timestamp less than 72</li>
<li>similarly, node Y also has a min timestamp that he will generate next
<ul>
<li>say 30</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we can take the minimum over all these minimums <code>min(30, 72) = 30</code> and
commit all operations up to that point</li>
<li>problem is it requires every node to be up and connected to all other nodes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Commit scheme for Bayou</h4>

<p>They have one magic node, a primary. Every update that passes through the primary,
the primary stamps it with a <em>commit sequence number</em> (CSN), the actual ordering number
becomes: <code>&lt;csn, T, node ID&gt;</code></p>

<ul>
<li>primary does not wait for earlier updates (with smaller <code>T</code>) to arrive first,
it just timestamps things as they come</li>
<li>commit preserves causal order</li>
<li>commit does not preserve wall clock order</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't have a CSN: <code>&lt;-, T, nodeID&gt;</code>. All commited operations are considered
to occur before uncommitted ones. </p>

<p><strong>TODO:</strong> not clear what this example was supposed to show</p>

<ul>
<li>A's meeting created</li>
<li>B's meeting created</li>
<li>B synchronizes with C</li>
<li>B synchronizes with A</li>
<li>C synchronizes with primary</li>
<li>primary applies CSN to A's op, but not B's</li>
<li>B synchronizes with primary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vector timestamps</h3>

<p>Synchronization</p>

<ul>
<li>A has 
    &lt;-, 10, X>
    &lt;-, 20, Y>
    &lt;-, 30, X>
    &lt;-, 40, X></li>
<li><p>B has
    &lt;-, 10, X>
    &lt;-, 20, Y>
    &lt;-, 30, X></p></li>
<li><p>A syncs with B
     sends a version vector to B describe which updates it has
     from every node
        A: [X 40, Y 20]
        (remember that the timestamps are always increased by senders)
        B: [X 30, Y 20]
        If B compares A's VT with his, he notices that he needs 
        updates by X between timestamp 30 and 40</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>A new node joins</h3>

<p>Now some VTs will have an entry for some new node Z. For instance, in the previous 
example</p>

<ul>
<li>A can send [X 40, Y 20, Z 60] to B</li>
</ul>

<p>We also need a way to remove nodes.</p>

<p>But B won't know if <code>Z</code> is newly added or newly deleted?</p>

<ul>
<li>Z joins the system</li>
<li>Z talks to X</li>
<li>X generates Z's unique node ID
    Z's ID = <Tz, X's node ID>, where Tz is the time Z talked to X</li>
<li><p>X sends an update timestamped with &lt;-, Tz, X> that says "new server z"
    Everybody will see this first before seeing Z's updates
        Z's updates have timestamps higher than Tz</p>

<ul>
<li>note that IDs are unbounded in size</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Forgetting nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Z's ID = &lt;20, X></li>
<li>A syncs -> B</li>
<li>A has log entry from Z &lt;-, 25, &lt;20, X>></li>
<li>B has no VT entry for Z</li>
</ul>

<p>Now B needs to figure out from A's updates if Z was added or removed</p>

<p>Case 1: If B's VT entry for <code>X</code> is less than the timestamp in <code>Z</code>'s ID, then
that means that <code>B</code> hasn't even seen the creation for <code>Z</code>, let alone any updates
from <code>Z</code> => <code>B</code> should create the entry for <code>Z</code> because <code>Z</code> is new to <code>B</code></p>

<p>Case 2: If B's VT entry for <code>X</code> is higher than the timestamp in <code>Z</code>'s ID, (ie.
B has seen updates from <code>X</code> after it created <code>Z</code>), then B must've seen <code>Z</code>'s 
creation <code>=&gt;</code> B must have seen a deletion notice</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> If Z's entry is missing from <code>B</code> then <code>Z</code> (probably?) says <code>&lt;-, T, Z&gt; bye, T &gt; Tz</code></p>

System</a> Terry, Theimer, Petersen, Demers, Spreitzer, 
Hauser, SOSP 95</p>

<p>Some material from <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arun/cs677/notes/Bayou.pdf">Flexible Update Propagation for Weakly Consistent 
Replication</a>, SOSP 97</p>

<h2>Why this paper?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Eventual consistency is pretty common
<ul>
<li>git, iPhone sync, Dropbox, Amazon Dynamo</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why do people like eventual consistency?
<ul>
<li>fast read/write of local copy (no primary, no paxos)</li>
<li>disconnected operation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What goes wrong?
<ul>
<li>doesn't look like "single copy" (no primary, no paxos)</li>
<li>conflicting writes to different copies</li>
<li>how to reconcile them when discovered?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bayou has the most sophisticated reconciliation story</li>
</ul>

<p>Paper context:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early 1990s (like Ficus)</li>
<li>Dawn of PDAs, laptops, tablets
<ul>
<li>H/W clunky but clear potential</li>
<li>Commercial devices did not have wireless</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Devices might be off or not have network access
<ul>
<li>This problem has not gone away!</li>
<li>iPhone sync, Dropbox sync, Dynamo</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's build a conference room scheduler</p>

<ul>
<li>Only one meeting allowed at a time (one room).</li>
<li>Each entry has a time and a description.</li>
<li>We want everyone to end up seeing the same set of entries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditional approach: one server</p>

<ul>
<li>Server executes one client request at a time</li>
<li>Checks for conflicting time, says yes or no</li>
<li>Updates DB</li>
<li>Proceeds to next request</li>
<li>Server implicitly chooses order for concurrent requests</li>
</ul>

<p>Why aren't we satisfied with central server?
 - I want to use scheduler on disconnected iPhone &amp;c
   + So need DB replica in each node.
   +  Modify on any node, as well as read.
 - Periodic connectivity to net.
 - Periodic direct contact with other calendar users (e.g. bluetooth).</p>

<h2>Straw man 1: merge DBs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Similar to iPhone calendar sync, or file sync.</li>
<li>May need to compare every DB entry -- lots of time and net b/w.</li>
<li>Still need a story for conflicting entries, i.e. two meetings at same time.
<ul>
<li>User may not be available to decide at time of DB merge.</li>
<li>So need automatic reconciliation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Idea for conflicts: update functions</p>

<ul>
<li>Application supplies a function, not a new value.</li>
<li>Read current state of DB, decide best change.</li>
<li>E.g. "Meet at 9 if room is free at 9, else 10, else 11."
<ul>
<li>Rather than just "Meet at 9"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Function can make reconciliation decision for absent user.</li>
<li>Sync exchanges functions, not DB content.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> can't just apply update functions to DB replica</p>

<ul>
<li>A's fn: staff meeting at 10:00 or 11:00</li>
<li>B's fn: hiring meeting at 10:00 or 11:00</li>
<li>X syncs w/ A, then B</li>
<li>Y syncs w/ B, then A</li>
<li>Will X put A's meeting at 10:00, and Y put A's at 11:00?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> eventual consistency</p>

<ul>
<li>OK for X and Y to disagree initially</li>
<li>But after enough syncing, all nodes' DBs should be identical</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Idea:</strong> ordered update log</p>

<ul>
<li>Ordered log of updates at each node.</li>
<li>Syncing == ensure both nodes have same updates in log.</li>
<li>DB is result of applying update functions in order.</li>
<li>Same log <code>=&gt;</code> same order <code>=&gt;</code> same DB content.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can nodes agree on update order?</p>

<ul>
<li>Update ID: <code>&lt;time T, node ID&gt;</code></li>
<li>T is creating node's wall-clock time.</li>
<li>Ordering updates a and b:
<ul>
<li><code>a &lt; b</code> if <code>a.T &lt; b.T</code> or (<code>a.T = b.T</code> and <code>a.ID &lt; b.ID</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;10,A&gt;: staff meeting at 10:00 or 11:00
 &lt;20,B&gt;: hiring meeting at 10:00 or 11:00

 what's the correct eventual outcome?
   the result of executing update functions in timestamp order
   staff at 10:00, hiring at 11:00
</code></pre>

<p>What DB content before sync?</p>

<ul>
<li>A: staff at 10:00</li>
<li>B: hiring at 10:00</li>
<li>This is what A/B user will see before syncing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now A and B sync with each other</p>

<ul>
<li>Each sorts new entries into its log, order by time-stamp</li>
<li>Both now know the full set of updates</li>
<li>A can just run B's update function</li>
<li>But B has <em>already</em> run B's operation, too soon!</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll back and replay</p>

<ul>
<li>B needs to to "roll back" DB, re-run both ops in the right order</li>
<li>Big point: the log holds the truth; the DB is just an optimization</li>
<li>We will optimize roll-back in a bit</li>
</ul>

<p>Displayed meeting room calendar entries are "tentative"</p>

<ul>
<li>B's user saw hiring at 10, then it changed to hiring at 11</li>
</ul>

<p>Will update order be consistent with wall-clock time?</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe A went first (in wall-clock time) with <code>&lt;10,A&gt;</code></li>
<li>Node clocks unlikely to be perfectly synchronized</li>
<li>So B could then generate &lt;9,B></li>
<li>B's meeting gets priority, even though A asked first</li>
<li>Not "externally consistent"</li>
</ul>

<p>Will update order be consistent with causality?</p>

<ul>
<li>What if A adds a meeting, 
<ul>
<li>then B sees A's meeting,</li>
<li>then B deletes A's meeting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perhaps
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;10,A&gt; add</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;9,B&gt; delete</code> -- B's clock is slow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now delete will be ordered before add!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lamport logical clocks for causal consistency</h3>

<ul>
<li>Want to timestamp events s.t.
<ul>
<li>if node observes E1, then generates E2, then <code>TS(E2) &gt; TS(E1)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>So all nodes will order E1, then E2</li>
<li><code>Tmax</code> = highest time-stamp seen from any node (including self)</li>
<li><code>T = max(Tmax + 1, wall-clock time)</code> -- to generate a timestamp</li>
<li>Note properties:
<ul>
<li>E1 then E2 on same node <code>=&gt; TS(E1) &lt; TS(E2)</code></li>
<li>BUT</li>
<li><code>TS(E1) &lt; TS(E2)</code> does not imply E1 came before E2</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Logical clock solves add/delete causality example
 - When B sees <code>&lt;10,A&gt;</code>,
   + B will set its Tmax to 10, so
   + B will generate <code>&lt;11,B&gt;</code> for its delete</p>

<p>Irritating that there could always be a long-delayed update with lower TS</p>

<ul>
<li>That can cause the results of my update to change
<ul>
<li>User can never be sure if meeting time is final!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Would be nice if updates were eventually "stable"
<ul>
<li><code>=&gt;</code> no changes in update order up to that point</li>
<li><code>=&gt;</code> results can never again change -- you know for sure when your meeting is</li>
<li><code>=&gt;</code> don't have to roll back, re-run committed updates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bad idea:</strong> a fully decentralized "commit" scheme</p>

<ul>
<li>Proposal: <code>&lt;10,A&gt;</code> is stable if all nodes have seen all updates w/ <code>TS &lt;= 10</code></li>
<li>Have sync always send in log order -- "prefix property"</li>
<li>If you have seen updates w/ <code>TS &gt; 10</code> from <em>every</em> node
<ul>
<li>Then you'll never again see one <code>&lt; &lt;10,A&gt;</code></li>
<li>So <code>&lt;10,A&gt;</code> is stable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why doesn't Bayou do this?
<ul>
<li>Not all nodes are connected to each other</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How does Bayou commit updates, so that they are stable?</p>

<ul>
<li>One node designated "primary replica".</li>
<li>It marks each update it receives with a permanent CSN.
<ul>
<li>Commit Sequence Number.</li>
<li>That update is committed.</li>
<li>So a complete time stamp is <code>&lt;CSN, local-time, node-id&gt;</code></li>
<li>Uncommitted updates (are considered to) come after all committed updates 
w/ this new timestamping scheme</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CSN notifications are synced between nodes.</li>
<li>The CSNs define a total order for committed updates.
<ul>
<li>All nodes will eventually agree on it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Will commit order match tentative order?</p>

<ul>
<li>Often.</li>
<li>Syncs send in log order (prefix property)
<ul>
<li>Including updates learned from other nodes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So if A's update log says
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;-,10,X&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;-,20,A&gt;</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A will send both to primary, in that order
<ul>
<li>Primary will assign CSNs in that order</li>
<li>Commit order will, in this case, match tentative order</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Will commit order always match tentative order?</p>

<ul>
<li>No: primary may see newer updates before older ones.</li>
<li>A has just: <code>&lt;-,10,A&gt; W1</code></li>
<li>B has just: <code>&lt;-,20,B&gt; W2</code></li>
<li>If <code>C</code> sees both, C's order: <code>W1 W2</code></li>
<li>B syncs with primary, gets <code>CSN=5</code>.</li>
<li>Later A syncs w/ primary, gets <code>CSN=6</code>.</li>
<li>When C syncs w/ primary, its order will change to <code>W2 W1</code>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;5,20,B&gt; W1</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;6,10,A&gt; W2</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>So: committing may change order.</li>
</ul>

<p>Committing allows app to tell users which calendar entries are stable.</p>

<ul>
<li>A stable meeting room time is final.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nodes can discard committed updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead, keep a copy of the DB as of the highest known CSN</li>
<li>Roll back to that DB when replaying tentative update log</li>
<li>Never need to roll back farther
<ul>
<li>Prefix property guarantees seen <code>CSN=x =&gt; seen CSN&lt;x</code></li>
<li>No changes to update order among committed updates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How do I sync if I've discarded part of my log?</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose I've discarded all updates with CSNs.</li>
<li>I keep a copy of the stable DB reflecting just discarded entries.</li>
<li>When I propagate to node <code>X</code>:
<ul>
<li>If node X's highest CSN is less than mine,
<ul>
<li>I can send him my stable DB reflecting just committed updates.</li>
<li>Node X can use my DB as starting point.</li>
<li>And X can discard all CSN log entries.</li>
<li>Then play his tentative updates into that DB.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If node X's highest CSN is greater than mine,
<ul>
<li>X doesn't need my DB.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>In practice, Bayou nodes keep the last few committed updates.
<ul>
<li>To reduce chance of having to send whole DB during sync.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How to sync?</p>

<ul>
<li>A sending to B</li>
<li>Need a quick way for B to tell A what to send</li>
<li>Committed updates easy: B sends its CSN to A</li>
<li>What about tentative updates?</li>
<li>A has:
<code>&lt;-,10,X&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;-,20,Y&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;-,30,X&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;-,40,X&gt;</code></li>
<li>B has:
<code>&lt;-,10,X&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;-,20,Y&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;-,30,X&gt;</code></li>
<li>At start of sync, B tells A "X 30, Y 20"
<ul>
<li>Sync prefix property means B has all X updates before 30, all Y before 20</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A sends all X's updates after <code>&lt;-,30,X&gt;</code>, all Y's updates after <code>&lt;-,20,X&gt;</code>, &amp;c</li>
<li>This is a version vector -- it summarize log content
<ul>
<li>It's the "F" vector in Figure 4</li>
<li>A's F: <code>[X:40,Y:20]</code></li>
<li>B's F: <code>[X:30,Y:20]</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How could we cope with a new server Z joining the system?</p>

<ul>
<li>Could it just start generating writes, e.g. <code>&lt;-,1,Z&gt;</code> ?</li>
<li>And other nodes just start including Z in VVs?</li>
<li>If A syncs to B, A has <code>&lt;-,10,Z&gt;</code>, but B has no Z in VV
<ul>
<li>A should pretend B's VV was <code>[Z:0,...]</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What happens when Z retires (leaves the system)?</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to stop including Z in VVs!</li>
<li>How to announce that Z is gone?
<ul>
<li>Z sends update <code>&lt;-,?,Z&gt; "retiring"</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you see a retirement update, omit Z from VV</li>
<li>How to deal with a VV that's missing Z?</li>
<li>If A has log entries from Z, but B's VV has no Z entry:
<ul>
<li>e.g. A has <code>&lt;-,25,Z&gt;</code>, B's VV is just <code>[A:20, B:21]</code></li>
<li>Maybe Z has retired, B knows, A does not</li>
<li>Maybe Z is new, A knows, B does not</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Need a way to disambiguate: Z missing from VV b/c new, or b/c retired?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bayou's retirement plan</p>

<ul>
<li>Z joins by contacting some server <code>X</code></li>
<li>Z's ID is generated by X as <code>&lt;Tz,X&gt;</code>
<ul>
<li>Tz is X's logical clock as of when Z joined</li>
<li>Note: unbounded ID size</li>
</ul></li>
<li>X issues <code>&lt;-,Tz,X&gt; "new server Z"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>How does <code>ID=&lt;Tz,X&gt;</code> scheme help disambiguate new vs forgotten?</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose Z's ID is <code>&lt;20,X&gt;</code></li>
<li>A syncs to B
<ul>
<li>A has log entry from <code>Z &lt;-,25,&lt;20,X&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li>B's VV has no Z entry</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One case:
<ul>
<li>B's VV: <code>[X:10, ...]</code></li>
<li><code>10 &lt; 20</code> implies B hasn't yet seen X's "new server Z" update</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The other case:
<ul>
<li>B's VV: <code>[X:30, ...]</code></li>
<li><code>20 &lt; 30</code> implies B once knew about Z, but then saw a retirement update</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's step back.</p>

<p>Is eventual consistency a useful idea?</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes: people want fast writes to local copies</li>
<li>iPhone sync, Dropbox, Dynamo, Riak, Cassandra, &amp;c</li>
</ul>

<p>Are update conflicts a real problem?</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes -- all systems have some more or less awkward solution</li>
</ul>

<p>Is Bayou's complexity warranted?</p>

<ul>
<li>I.e. log of update functions, version vectors, tentative operations</li>
<li>Only critical if you want peer-to-peer sync
<ul>
<li>I.e. both disconnected operation AND ad-hoc connectivity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only tolerable if humans are main consumers of data</li>
<li>Otherwise you can sync through a central server (iPhone, Dropbox)</li>
<li>Or read locally but send updates through a master (PNUTS, Spanner)</li>
</ul>

<p>But there's are good ideas for us to learn from Bayou</p>

<ul>
<li>Update functions for automatic application-driven conflict resolution</li>
<li>Ordered update log is the real truth, not the DB</li>
<li>Logical clock for causal consistency</li>
</ul>
