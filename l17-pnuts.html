<h1>6.824 2015 Lecture 17: PNUTS</h1>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These lecture notes were slightly modified from the ones posted on the
6.824 <a href="http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2015/schedule.html">course website</a> from 
Spring 2015.</p>

<h1>PNUTS</h1>

<ul>
<li>a solution to the same problem Spanner and memcached solved</li>
<li>PNUTS is a more-principled designed than the memcache Facebook design
<ul>
<li>"it was actually designed"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>make reads fast</li>
<li>upside: web applications are able to do fast local reads due to replication</li>
<li>downside: writes will be slow, because they need to be replicated</li>
<li>because writes have to be distributed to all the regions, there will
be a fundamental delay between when writes happen and when the updates
actually propagate
<ul>
<li><code>=&gt;</code> potential for stale reads</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if there's data that could be updated by concurrent clients, there will
be a problem with multiple writes
<ul>
<li>need all regions to see our writes in the same order</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Diagram:</p>

<pre><code>Region R1                        Region R2
---------                        ---------

 W1 Mesage broker                 W1 Message broker
 W2     (replicated)              W2     (replicated)

    SU1 SU2 SU3 ...                  SU1 SU2 SU3 ...
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>each region has its own set of webservers</li>
<li>each region stores all data</li>
<li>each table in a region is partitioned among storage units (SUs)</li>
<li>routers know the partitioning</li>
<li>each SU has a disk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>each record in PNUTS has its own master region through which all writes have
to go
<ul>
<li>different than memcache at facebook, they had a master region for <em>all</em>
records</li>
<li>in PNUTS every record has a different master</li>
<li>Note: a record is just a row in a table (and has an extra field that
stores its master)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>updating records that are in regions far away from the user will take longer
of course</li>
<li>how does the webserver know where to send the update?
<ul>
<li>contact one of the routers</li>
<li>router looks at the key, knows it's stored in say SU3</li>
<li>find out from SU3 that a different region <code>r2</code> has the master copy
<ul>
<li>doesn't know which SU at <code>r2</code> the record is at</li>
</ul></li>
<li>contact one of the routers in <code>r2</code></li>
<li>router tells you the SU to store it at</li>
<li>the SU then needs to send out the update to all the other regions</li>
<li>the SU sends the update to the message brokers
<ul>
<li>not clear if SU applies the update to its own disk before</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the message broker writes a copy of the update to the disk
because it is <em>committing</em> to actually sending the update everywhere
<ul>
<li>important because we don't want a failed server to result in partially 
propagating the update</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the MB will send it out to other MBs at other sites </li>
<li>somehow the web app needs to find out that the write completes
<ul>
<li>not clear who sends the ACK back</li>
<li>seems that the MB replies back to the webserver app as soon as it 
commits the update to the disk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>asynchronous writes because, from POV of webapp, write is done when MB has
written it to its disk</li>
<li>why isn't the MB a bottleneck? It has to write a lot of stuff:
<ul>
<li>different applications have a different message broker</li>
<li>MB may be able to do much more batching of the writes</li>
<li>maybe also MB writes are also less complex than normal database writes
where you have to modify Btrees, maybe go through a file system, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>because they funnel all the writes through some MB they get some 
semantics for writes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Write semantics</h2>

<h3>Write order to single records</h3>

<pre><code>Name        Where       What
----        -----       ----
Alice       home        asleep
Bob
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Alice writes where record which has 3 columns (Name, Where, What)</li>
<li>Alice's application says <code>write(what=awake)</code>
<ul>
<li>write goes through PNUTS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alice's application says <code>write(where=work)</code>
<ul>
<li>write goes through PNUTS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>useful semantics given by PNUTS
<ul>
<li>other people in different regions might see
<ul>
<li>alice at home asleep</li>
<li>alice at home awake</li>
<li>alice at work awake</li>
</ul></li>
<li>other people won't see a view of the record inconsistent with the order of
the writes
<ul>
<li>alice at work asleep</li>
</ul></li>
<li>kind of the main consistency semantics provided by PNUTS</li>
<li>a result of sequencing the writes through the MBs</li>
<li>paper calls this <em>per-record timeline consistency</em></li>
<li>note that their model restricts them to only have transactions on a 
single record basis</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>When would you care about stale data?</h3>

<ul>
<li>after you added something to your shopping cart, you would expect to see it
there</li>
</ul>

<p>Reads vs. staleness</p>

<pre><code>    read-any(key) -&gt; fast read, just executes the read on the SU and does
                   not wait for any writes to propagate

    read-critical(key, ver) -&gt; returns the read record where ver(record) &gt;= ver
     - useful for reading your own writes
     - true when you have one webpage in a single tab
     - if you update your shopping cart in one tab, then the other tab
       will not be aware of that version number from the first tab

    read-latest(key) -&gt; will always go to the master copy and read the latest
                      data there
</code></pre>

<h3>Writes, atomic updates</h3>

<p>Example: increment a counter in a record</p>

<pre><code>    test-and-set-write(ver, key, newvalue) -&gt; always gets sent to the master
        region for the key. look at the version and if it matches provided
        one then update the record with the new value

        // implementing v[k]++
        while true:
            (x, v) = read-latest(k)
            if test-and-set-write(k, v, x+1)
                break
</code></pre>

<h2>Question of the day</h2>

<p>Alice comes back from spring break and she:</p>

<ul>
<li>removes her mom from her ACL</li>
<li>posts spring break photos</li>
</ul>

<p>Can her mom see her photos due to out-of-order writes?</p>

<p>If Alice has all the photos her mom can see in a single record, then no.</p>

<pre><code>Alice   |   ACL     | List of photos
-------- ----------- ----------------
            mom         p7, p99
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming the code her mom is executing reads the full record (ACL + photos) when
doing the check, and doesn't first read the ACL, wait a while and then read
the photos</p>

<h2>Failures</h2>

<p>If webapp server fails in the middle of doing a bunch of writes, then only
partial info would have been written to PNUTS, possibly leading to corruption.</p>

<ul>
<li>no transactions for multiple writes</li>
</ul>

<p>If SU crashes and reboots, it can recover from disk and MB can keep retrying it</p>

<p>What happens when SU loses its disk? It needs to recover the data.</p>

<ul>
<li>the paper says the SU will clone its data from a SU from another region
<ul>
<li>main challenge is that updates are being sent by MBs to records that
are being copied</li>
<li>either updates go to source of copy, or destination of copy remembers the
update</li>
<li>ultimately they both need to have the update in the end</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Evaluation mostly focuses on latency and not on throughput. Maybe this is
specific to their needs.</p>

<p>Not clear how they can support millions of users with MBs that can only do
hundreds of writes per second.</p>

<p>Why is it taking them 75ms to do a local update, where everyone is in the same
region?</p>

<ul>
<li>computation, disk, network?</li>
<li>75ms is enormous for a write in a DB</li>
</ul>

Silberstein, Philip Bohannon, Hans-Arno Jacobsen, Nick Puz, Daniel
Weaver and Ramana Yerneni. PNUTS: Yahoo!'s Hosted Data Serving
Platform. Proceedings of VLDB, 2008.</p>

<p>Why this paper?</p>

<ul>
<li>same basic goals as Facebook/memcache paper, more principled design</li>
<li>multi-region is very challenging -- 100ms network delays</li>
<li>conscious trade-off between consistency and performance</li>
</ul>

<p>What is PNUTS' overall goal?</p>

<p>Diagram:</p>

<pre><code>[world, browsers, data centers]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>overall story similar to that of Spanner and Facebook/memcache</li>
<li>data centers ("regions") all over the world</li>
<li>web applications, e.g. mail, shopping, social net
<ul>
<li>each app probably runs at all regions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PNUTS keeps state for apps
<ul>
<li>per-user: profile, shopping cart, friend list</li>
<li>per-item: book popularity, user comments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>app might need any piece of data at any data center</li>
<li>need to handle lots of concurrent updates to different data
<ul>
<li>e.g. lots of users must be able to add items to shopping cart at same time
thus 1000s of PNUTS servers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1000s of servers => crashes must be frequent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Diagram:</p>

<pre><code>3 regions, browsers, web apps, tablet ctlrs, routers, storage units, MBs]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>each region has all data</li>
<li>each table partitioned by key over storage units
<ul>
<li>tablet servers + routers know the partition plan</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Why replicas of all data at multiple regions?</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple regions -> each user's data geographically close to user</li>
<li>multiple complete replicas -> maybe survive entire region failure</li>
<li>complete replicas -> read anything quickly
<ul>
<li>since some data used by many users / many regions</li>
<li>once you have multiple regions, fast reads are very important</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What are the drawbacks of a copy at each region?</p>

<ul>
<li>updates will be slow, need to contact every region</li>
<li>local reads will probably be stale</li>
<li>updates from multiple regions need to be sorted out
<ul>
<li>keep replicas identical</li>
<li>avoid order anomalies</li>
<li>don't lose updates (e.g. read-modify-write for counter)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>disk space probably not an issue for their uses</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the data and query model?</p>

<ul>
<li>basically key/value</li>
<li>reads/writes probably by column
<ul>
<li>so a write might replace just one column, not whole record</li>
</ul></li>
<li>range scan for ordered tables</li>
</ul>

<p>How do updates work?</p>

<ul>
<li>app server gets web request, needs to write data in PNUTS</li>
<li>need to update every region!</li>
<li>why not just have app logic send update to every region?
<ul>
<li>what if app crashes after updating only some regions?</li>
<li>what if concurrent updates to same record?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>PNUTS has a "record master" for each record</p>

<ul>
<li>all updates must go through that region
<ul>
<li>each record has a hidden column indicating region of record master</li>
</ul></li>
<li>responsible storage unit executes updates one at a time per record</li>
<li>tells MB to broadcast update to all regions</li>
<li>per-record master probably better than Facebook/memcache master region</li>
</ul>

<p>So the complete update story (some guesswork):</p>

<p>App wants to update some columns of a record, knows key</p>

<ol>
<li>app sends key and update to local SU1</li>
<li>SU1 looks up record master for key: SI2</li>
<li>SU1 sends update request to router at SI2</li>
<li>router at SI2 forwards update to local SU2 for key</li>
<li>SU2 sends update to local Message Broker (MB)</li>
<li>MB stores on disk + backup MB, sends vers # to original app
 how does MB know the vers #? maybe SU2 told it
 or perhaps SU2 (not MB) replies to original app</li>
<li>MB sends update to router at every region</li>
<li>every region updates local copy</li>
</ol>

<p>Puzzles:</p>

<ul>
<li>3.2.1 says MB is commit point
<ul>
<li>i.e. MB writes to log on two disks, keeps trying to deliver
why isn't MB disk a terrible bottleneck?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>does update go to MB then SU2? or SU2 then MB? or SU2, MB, SU2?
<ul>
<li>maybe MB then SU2, since MB is commit point</li>
<li>maybe SU2 then MB, since SU2 has to check it's the record's master
and perhaps pick the new version number, tho maybe not needed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>who replies to client w/ new version #?</li>
</ul>

<p>All writes are multi-region and thus slow -- why does it make sense?</p>

<ul>
<li>application waits for MB commit but not propagation ("asynchronous")</li>
<li>master likely to be local (they claim 80% of the time)
<ul>
<li>so MB commit will often be quick</li>
<li>and app/user will often see its own writes soon</li>
</ul></li>
<li>still, eval says 300ms if master is remote!</li>
<li>down side: readers at non-master regions may see stale data</li>
</ul>

<p>How does a read-only query execute?</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple kinds of reads (section 2.2) -- why?</li>
<li>application gets to choose how consistent</li>
<li><code>read-any(k)</code>
<ul>
<li>read from local SU</li>
<li>might return stale data (even if you just wrote!)</li>
<li>why: app wants speed but doesn't care about freshness</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>read-critical(k, required_version)</code>
<ul>
<li>maybe read from local SU if it has vers >= required_version</li>
<li>otherwise read from master SU?</li>
<li>why: app wants to see its own write</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>read-latest(k)</code>
<ul>
<li>always read from master SU (? "if local copy too stale")</li>
<li>slow if master is remote!</li>
<li>why: app needs fresh data</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What if app needs to increment a counter stored in a record?</p>

<ul>
<li>app reads old value, increments locally, writes new value</li>
<li>what if the local read produced stale data?</li>
<li>what if read was OK, but concurrent updates?</li>
</ul>

<p><code>test-and-set-write(version#, new value)</code> gives you atomic update to one record
 - master rejects the write if current version # != version#
 - so if concurrent updates, one will lose and retry </p>

<p><code>TestAndSet</code> example:</p>

<pre><code>  while(1):
    (x, ver) = read-latest(k)
    if(t-a-s-w(k, ver, x+1))
      break
</code></pre>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<ul>
<li>how does PNUTS cope with Example 1 (page 2)</li>
<li>Initially Alice's mother is in Alice's ACL, so mother can see photos
<ol>
<li>Alice removes her mother from ACL</li>
<li>Alice posts spring-break photos</li>
</ol></li>
<li>could her mother see update #2 but not update #1?
<ul>
<li>esp if mother uses different region than Alice
or if Alice does the updates from different regions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ACL and photo list must be in the same record
<ul>
<li>since PNUTS guarantees order only for updates to same record</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alice sends updates to her record's master region in order
<ul>
<li>master region broadcasts via MB in order</li>
<li>MB tells other regions to apply updates in order</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if Alice's mother:
<ul>
<li>reads the old ACL, that includes mother</li>
<li>reads the new photo list</li>
<li>answer: just one read of Alice's record, has both ACL and photo list
<ul>
<li>if record doesn't have new ACL, order says it can't have new photos either</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How could a storage system get this wrong?
<ul>
<li>No ordering through single master (e.g. Dynamo)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How to change record's master if no failures?</p>

<ul>
<li>e.g. I move from Boston to LA</li>
<li>perhaps just update the record, via old master?
<ul>
<li>since ID of master region is stored in the record</li>
</ul></li>
<li>old master announces change over MB</li>
<li>a few subsequent updates might go to the old master
<ul>
<li>it will reject them, app retries and finds new master?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What if we wanted to do bank transfers?</p>

<ul>
<li>from one account (record) to another</li>
<li>can <code>t-a-s-w</code> be used for this?</li>
<li>multi-record updates are not atomic
<ul>
<li>other readers can see intermediate state</li>
<li>other writers are not locked out</li>
</ul></li>
<li>multi-record reads are not atomic
<ul>
<li>might read one account before xfer, other account after xfer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Is lack of general transactions a problem for web applications?</p>

<ul>
<li>maybe not, if programmers know to expect it</li>
</ul>

<p>What about tolerating failures?</p>

<p>App server crashes midway through a set of updates</p>

<ul>
<li>not a transaction, so only some of writes will happen</li>
<li>but master SU/MB either did or didn't get each write
<ul>
<li>so each write happens at all regions, or none</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>SU down briefly, or network temporarily broken/lossy</p>

<ul>
<li>(I'm guessing here, could be wrong)</li>
<li>MB keeps trying until SU acks
<ul>
<li>SU shouldn't ACK until safely on disk</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>SU loses disk contents, or doesn't automatically reboot </p>

<ul>
<li>can apps read from remote regions?
<ul>
<li>paper doesn't say</li>
</ul></li>
<li>need to restore disk content from SUs at other regions
<ol>
<li>subscribe to MB feed, and save them for now</li>
<li>copy content from SU at another region</li>
<li>replay saved MB updates</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Puzzle: 
<ul>
<li>how to ensure we didn't miss any MB updates for this SU?
<ul>
<li>e.g. subscribe to MB at time=100, but source SU only saw through 90?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>will replay apply updates twice? is that harmful?</li>
<li>paper mentions sending checkpoint message through MB
<ul>
<li>maybe fetch copy as of when the checkpoint arrived</li>
<li>and only replay after the checkpoint</li>
<li>BUT no ordering among MB streams from multiple regions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>MB crashes after accepting update</p>

<ul>
<li>logs to disks on two MB servers before ACKing</li>
<li>recovery looks at log, (re)sends logged msgs</li>
<li>record master SU maybe re-sends an update if MB crash before ACK
<ul>
<li>maybe record version #s will allow SUs to ignore duplicate</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>MB is a neat idea</p>

<ul>
<li>atomic: updates all replicas, or none
<ul>
<li>rather than app server updating replicas (crash...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>reliable: keeps trying, to cope with temporarily SU/region failure</li>
<li>async: apps don't have to wait for write to complete, good for WAN</li>
<li>ordered: keeps replicas identical even w/ multiple writers</li>
</ul>

<p>Record's master region loses network connection</p>

<ul>
<li>can other regions designate a replacement RM?
<ul>
<li>no: original RM's MB may have logged updates, only some sent out</li>
</ul></li>
<li>do other regions have to wait indefinitely? yes
<ul>
<li>this is one price of ordered updates / strict-ish consistency</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>Evaluation focuses on latency and scaling, not throughput</p>

<p>5.2: time for an insert while busy</p>

<ul>
<li>depends on how far away Record Master is</li>
<li>RM local: 75.6 ms</li>
<li>RM nearby: 131.5 ms</li>
<li>RM other coast: 315.5 ms</li>
</ul>

<p>What is 5.2 measuring? from what to what?</p>

<ul>
<li>maybe web server starts insert, to RM replies w/ new version?</li>
<li>not time for MB to propagate to all regions
<ul>
<li>since then local RM wouldn't be <code>&lt; remote</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Why 75 ms?</p>

<p>Is it 75 ms of network speed-of-light delay?</p>

<ul>
<li>no: local</li>
</ul>

<p>Is the 75 ms mostly queuing, waiting for other client's operations?</p>

<ul>
<li>no: they imply 100 clients was max that didn't cause delay to rise</li>
</ul>

<p>End of 5.2 suggests 40 ms of 75 ms in in SU</p>

<ul>
<li>how could it take 40 ms?
<ul>
<li>each key/value is one file?</li>
<li>creating a file takes 3 disk writes (directory, inode, content)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>what's the other 35 ms?
<ul>
<li>MB disk write?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>But only 33 ms (not 75) for "ordered table" (MySQL/Innodb)</p>

<ul>
<li>closer to the one or two disk write we'd expect</li>
</ul>

<p>5.3 / Figure 3: effect of increasing request rate</p>

<ul>
<li>what do we expect for graph w/ x-axis req rate, y-axis latency?
<ul>
<li>system has some inherent capacity, e.g. total disk seeks/second</li>
<li>for lower rates, constant latency</li>
<li>for higher rates, queue grows rapidly, avg latency blows up</li>
</ul></li>
<li>blow-up should be near max capacity of h/w
<ul>
<li>e.g. # disk arms / seek time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we don't see that in Figure 3
<ul>
<li>apparently their clients were not able to generate too much load</li>
<li>end of 5.3 says clients too slow</li>
<li>at >= 75 ms/op, 300 clients -> about 4000/sec</li>
</ul></li>
<li>text says max possible rate was about 3000/second
<ul>
<li>10% writes, so 300 writes/second</li>
<li>5 SU per region, so 60 writes/SU/second</li>
<li>about right if each write does a random disk I/O</li>
<li>but you'll need lots of SUs for millions of active users</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Stepping back, what were PNUTS key design decisions?</p>

<ol>
<li>replication of all data at multiple regions
<ul>
<li>fast reads, slow writes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>relaxed consistency -- stale reads
<ul>
<li>b/c writes are slow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>only single-row transactions w/ test-and-set-write</li>
<li>sequence all writes thru master region
<ul>
<li>pro: keeps replicas identical,
enforces serial order on updates,
easy to reason about</li>
<li>con: slow, no progress if master region disconnected</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Next: Dynamo, a very different design</p>

<ul>
<li>async replication, but no master</li>
<li>eventual consistency</li>
<li>always allow updates</li>
<li>tree of versions if network partitions</li>
<li>readers must reconcile versions</li>
</ul>
